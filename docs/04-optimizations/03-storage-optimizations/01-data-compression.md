title: Data Compression

## Overview

Data compression is a fundamental storage optimization technique in LSM Tree databases that reduces the physical size of data on disk. By encoding data more efficiently, compression reduces storage requirements, improves I/O bandwidth utilization, and can even enhance cache efficiency.

The "write once, read many" nature of SSTables makes them ideal candidates for compression, as the compression overhead is paid once during writing but benefits are realized repeatedly during reads.


## Compression Approaches

LSM Tree databases typically implement compression at multiple levels:

### Block-Level Compression

The most common approach compresses individual data blocks within SSTables:

1. **Process**:
   - Each data block (typically 4-64KB) is compressed independently
   - Block boundaries allow random access without decompressing entire files
   - Metadata and indexes typically remain uncompressed for faster access

2. **Benefits**:
   - Good compression ratio while maintaining random access capability
   - Failed block decompression affects only a small portion of data
   - Memory requirements for decompression are bounded by block size

### Key Compression Techniques

Several techniques specifically optimize key storage:

1. **Prefix Compression**:
   - Adjacent keys often share common prefixes
   - Only the unique suffix is stored for each key after the first
   - Particularly effective for lexicographically ordered keys

2. **Delta Encoding**:
   - Store differences between consecutive keys rather than full keys
   - Very efficient for sequential numeric keys
   - Can be combined with prefix compression

### Value Compression Approaches

Value compression can be implemented in several ways:

1. **Direct Compression**:
   - Values are compressed individually or in groups
   - Good for large values that compress well independently

2. **Dictionary Compression**:
   - Common values or patterns are replaced with references to a dictionary
   - Highly effective for datasets with repetitive values


## Compression Algorithms

LSM Tree implementations typically support multiple compression algorithms, each with different trade-offs:

### Snappy
- **Characteristics**: Very fast compression/decompression, moderate compression ratio
- **Compression Ratio**: Typically 2-4x
- **Use Case**: General-purpose default, prioritizing speed over compression ratio
- **CPU Overhead**: Very low

### LZ4
- **Characteristics**: Fast compression, very fast decompression, good compression ratio
- **Compression Ratio**: Typically 2.5-5x
- **Use Case**: Good balance of speed and compression
- **CPU Overhead**: Low

### Zstandard (ZSTD)
- **Characteristics**: Moderate speed, excellent compression ratio, configurable levels
- **Compression Ratio**: Typically 3-7x depending on level
- **Use Case**: When storage efficiency is more important than CPU usage
- **CPU Overhead**: Moderate (configurable)

### GZIP/Zlib
- **Characteristics**: Slower compression, good decompression speed, high compression ratio
- **Compression Ratio**: Typically 3-6x
- **Use Case**: Archival or rarely accessed data
- **CPU Overhead**: Higher

## Performance Implications

Data compression affects LSM Tree performance in multiple dimensions:

- **I/O Reduction**: Less data read from/written to disk improves throughput
  - Particularly beneficial for I/O-bound systems

- **Cache Efficiency**: More logical data fits in the same memory space
  - Compressed blocks in cache represent more usable data

- **CPU Trade-off**: Decompression adds CPU overhead to the read path
  - Modern algorithms and hardware make this trade-off increasingly favorable

- **Compaction Benefits**: Smaller SSTables reduce compaction I/O and time
  - Speeds up one of the most resource-intensive background processes

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing compression in LSM Tree systems, several factors should be considered:

### Compression Unit Size

- **Block Size vs. Compression Ratio**: 
  - Larger blocks generally provide better compression ratios
  - Smaller blocks offer more granular random access
  - Typical sweet spot: 16-32KB blocks

### Algorithm Selection Factors

- **Workload Nature**: Read-heavy vs. write-heavy
- **Hardware Capabilities**: CPU resources vs. I/O capabilities
- **Data Characteristics**: Compressibility of the actual data

### Dynamic Compression

Some advanced implementations support:
- Different compression algorithms for different LSM Tree levels
- Dynamic algorithm selection based on observed compression ratios
- Skipping compression for data that doesn't compress well

:::warning
Compression can mask I/O bottlenecks by trading CPU for I/O reduction. Always monitor both CPU and I/O metrics when tuning compression settings, as optimal settings can shift as workloads or hardware change.

## Real-World Implementations

- **RocksDB**: Supports per-level compression with multiple algorithms
- **Cassandra**: Allows table-level compression configuration
- **LevelDB**: Implements Snappy compression by default

:::tip
For time-series data or append-only logs, consider using stronger compression algorithms for older data (lower levels of the LSM tree) and faster algorithms for newer data (upper levels). This optimizes for write speed on hot data while maximizing space savings for cold data.

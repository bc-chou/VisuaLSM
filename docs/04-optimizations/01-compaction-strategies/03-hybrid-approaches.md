title: Hybrid Compaction Approaches
---

## Overview

Hybrid compaction approaches combine elements from different strategies to balance the trade-offs between read performance, write throughput, and space efficiency. This concept recognizes that no single compaction strategy is optimal for all scenarios or all levels of the LSM Tree.


## Core Concept: Tiered-Leveled Hybrid

The most fundamental hybrid approach combines Size-Tiered Compaction for lower levels and Leveled Compaction for higher levels:

### Key Principles

- **Lower Levels (L0-L1)**: Use size-tiered organization to optimize for write throughput
- **Higher Levels (L2+)**: Use leveled organization to optimize for read performance

### Benefits

- Preserves write performance while improving read performance
- Reduces overall write amplification compared to pure leveled compaction
- Provides better space efficiency than pure size-tiered compaction

## Workload-Specific Adaptations

The hybrid approach can be adapted for specific workload patterns:

### Time-Series Data

For time-series workloads, compaction can be organized around time windows:

- Group data by time periods (hourly, daily, weekly)
- Apply different compaction policies to recent vs. historical data
- Optimize for typical time-series access patterns (recent data more frequently accessed)

### Mixed Read/Write Workloads

For workloads with varying read/write ratios:

- Balance compaction resources based on current workload
- Adjust compaction aggressiveness dynamically
- Prioritize different optimization goals during different operational phases

## Performance Implications

Hybrid approaches offer several advantages:

- More balanced performance across all three amplification dimensions
- Better adaptation to complex workload patterns
- More efficient resource utilization

These benefits come with the trade-off of increased implementation complexity and more challenging configuration.

:::tip
Hybrid approaches are most valuable when your workload doesn't fit neatly into the categories that pure size-tiered or leveled compaction were designed for. For simpler use cases, the added complexity may not be justified.
